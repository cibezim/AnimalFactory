# AnimalFactory

Behavioral Design Patterns:

Observer Pattern:
   - Allows one object to inform many others when it changes, ensuring they all stay updated automatically.

   Strategy Pattern:
   - Lets you define a family of algorithms, make them interchangeable, and choose the right one as needed.

   Command Pattern:
   - Turns a request into a standalone object, allowing parameterization of clients with different requests.

Creational Design Patterns:

Singleton Pattern:
   - Ensures a class has only one instance globally accessible.

Factory Method Pattern:
   - Defines an interface for creating objects but leaves the choice of type to subclasses.

Abstract Factory Pattern:
   - Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

### Structural Design Patterns:

Adapter Pattern:
   - Makes one interface compatible with another.

Decorator Pattern:
   - Adds new responsibilities to an object dynamically.

Proxy Pattern:
   - Acts as a substitute for another object, controlling access.
